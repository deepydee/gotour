# Welcome to a tour of Go
## Using the tour

Welcome to a tour of the Go programming language. The tour covers the most important features of the language, mainly:

- Welcome!
Learn how to use this tour: including how to navigate the different lessons and how to run code.

### Basics

The starting point, learn all the basics of the language.
Declaring variables, calling functions, and all the things you need to know before moving to the next lessons.

- Packages, variables, and functions.
Learn the basic components of any Go program.

- Flow control statements: for, if, else, switch and defer
Learn how to control the flow of your code with conditionals, loops, switches and defers.

- More types: structs, slices, and maps.
Learn how to define types based on existing ones: this lesson covers structs, arrays, slices, and maps.

### Methods and interfaces

Learn how to define methods on types, how to declare interfaces, and how to put everything together.

Methods and interfaces
This lesson covers methods and interfaces, the constructs that define objects and their behavior.

### Generics

Learn how to use type parameters in Go functions and structs.

Generics
Go supports generic programming using type parameters. This lesson shows some examples for employing generics in your code.

### Concurrency

Go provides concurrency features as part of the core language.

This module goes over goroutines and channels, and how they are used to implement different concurrency patterns.

Concurrency
Go provides concurrency constructions as part of the core language. This lesson presents them and gives some examples on how they can be used.
